### Scrambled Seas mod for Sailwind
### Version 6.0
### Author: Rahakami

This is a randomizer mod, which greatly increases the game difficulty by leaving it up to the player to discover and plot each island.
When a new game is started, a seed is generated for that savegame. That seed will result in a unique world map for you to explore. 
There is no helpful in-game map at the time, so draw a paper map while you play or come up with your own solution.

Features:
- Randomized island placement
- Starting gold is increased to 500, to help you get on your feet
- More details on Discord #sailwind-mods
